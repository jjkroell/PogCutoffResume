# PogCutoffResume
Attiny412 low voltage cutoff, delayed resume

ok I think I have the firmware for the cutoff boards finished now.

# Properties:
- 1.8-5.5V operating voltage
- 2A max continuous current on output
- -40-105C temperature range
- 20x20mm board, holes centered at 15x15mm
- Source battery on VIN, node on VOUT
- <2mA during normal operation, <1uA during cutoff
- operating frequency: 1MHz
- VCC sampling frequency during normal operation: 100Hz (approximately)
- VCC sampling every 10 seconds during cutoff
- Charging the battery via USB from the node-side works even with the cutoff board between the battery and node

# Functions:
- cutoff at minimum voltage
- resume at resume voltage
- max temperature cutoff (could flipflop a bit since theres no hysteresis, but you have bigger things to worry about at this point)
- periodic reset
- idle reset, listen for LOW pin state on aux2 pin. Positive value = reset, negative = cutoff and sleep until LOW pin state on aux2 pin again.
- single button menu to configure the board during runtime

# Flashing the boards (install.sh)

`install.sh` builds the firmware and flashes it onto ATtiny412 boards over a
serial-UPDI programmer (a CH340 / CP2102 / FTDI USB-serial adapter wired for
UPDI). For each board it erases, writes the **1.8 V brown-out** fuse, flashes and
**verifies** the firmware, prints a **SUCCESSFUL** prompt, then **auto-detects the
next board** so a whole batch can be flashed hands-free.

```
git clone https://github.com/jjkroell/PogCutoffResume.git
cd PogCutoffResume
./install.sh
```

It installs PlatformIO + pymcuprog if they are missing, builds the firmware, then
asks you to connect the programmer. Insert a board, wait for the SUCCESSFUL
prompt, swap to the next one — press Ctrl-C to finish. If a board is pulled too
early or fails to seat, that board is retried automatically (nothing is skipped).

**Serial-UPDI wiring:** programmer **UPDI** -> header **J2 middle pin**
(PA0/RESET/UPDI); **GND** -> any GND pad; **VCC/+** -> VIN. (J2's other two pins
are PA2 and PA3/AUX2, so do not wire a 3-pin UPDI/VCC/GND harness straight across
J2.)

Manual flashing without the script:

```
cd ATTiny412
pio run -e ATtiny412 -t upload      # firmware
pio run -e set_fuses -t fuses       # 1.8 V brown-out fuse
```

# Testing Info:
So I really havent had time to do extensive testing, but I have tested the below:

- Temperature cutoff works when i point a hair dryer at it. I did not check how accurate the sensor is, but it shows 20C when at room temp, so thats good enough for me.
- Voltage cutoff is quick enough that the tiny little capacitor on VCC has enough power left to run the MCU for about a minute after cutoff.
- Resume voltage works.
- Idle timeout reset positive values work. havent tried negative values... dont have something to test it reliably right now.
- Periodic reset works.
- Voltage accuracy is to within a few mV (the voltage supply is not granular enough to test super accurately).
- Power consumption is about 1uA average when in cutoff mode. good enough. Under 2mA during normal operation.
- Menu enter, set, save, exit. All works, but sometimes the values stick during cutoff and are not applied until resume voltage is reached. I have dig a bit deeper.
- Output power is cut and resumed successfully in each scenario.

# To use the configuration menu:
- One button press to enter
- when the button is released, the menu item and value in their array position are shown as long and short flashes.
- short press (< 1s) changes config value
- Long press (1s to 5s) changes the config item
- Longer press (5s or more) exits the config menu
- 30second timeout if button is not pressed
- reset all configs to defaults by using the 6th menu option with a value of 5

# Config menu options
| Long Flash \ Short Flash|1 (default)|2|3|4|5|
|:-------------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|1: Cutoff Voltage|3000|2900|3100|2800|3200|
|2: Resume Voltage|3600|3300|3700|3900|4100|
|3: Days Between Reset|0|7|14|1|3|
|4: Max Temperature Cutoff|60|65|50|70|0|
|5: Idle Time Reset|0|30|60|-600*|-1800*|
|6: Set Config to Defaults|0|0|0|0|1|

*reset on positive values, cutoff on negative values 

Arrays used to store config values:

int minimumVoltageArray[5] = {3000, 2900, 3100, 2800, 3200}; //minimum voltage to trigger cuttoff

int resumeVoltageArray[5] = {3600, 3300, 3700, 3900, 4100}; //minimum voltage to resume providing power to the node

int resetTriggerPeriodArray[5] = {0, 7, 14, 1, 3}; //reset trigger period in days. default (index 0) = 0 = OFF. aux1 pin output

int maxTempCutoffArrray[5] = {60, 65, 50, 70, 0}; //min internal temp sensor value in Celsius to trigger cutoff. 0 = OFF

int IdleResetArray[5] = {0, 30, 60, -600, -1800}; //duration between pin status change on aux2 (LOW pin state) in seconds. reset positive, cutoff negative. 0 = OFF.
